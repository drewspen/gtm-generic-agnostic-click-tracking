Google Tag Manager GTM Generic Site Agnostic Click Tracking

This repository contains a JSON object that can be imported into a new workspace in Google Tag Manager and published to an existing GTM container. It is agnostic of the site being Sitecore or Wordpress or AEM or a React SPA, etc. It captures the clicks, and attempts to identify the click element by id, class name, text, aria-label, data-tested, alt text, click URL, etc. It breaks down the click URL so you can leverage it for either measuring social media link clicks - click host name - or PDF downloads - click document. If, for example, your click is identified by an aria-label that is not set on the specific click element, but on the parent tag of the element, the code searches up 3 levels to identify the value. If your web developers used something other than aria-label or data-tested, etc to identify click elements, you can use this as a template. The only thing you need to change for the code to work is replace the {{GAID}} reference with the value used in your site GTM container.
